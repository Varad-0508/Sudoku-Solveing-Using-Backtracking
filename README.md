# Sudoku-Solveing-Using-Backtracking
Java Code that reads any NxN Sudoku-puzzle from a file and finds solution to it. 
Uses Recursive Backtracking algorithm and therefore a solution is always gauranteed, except in case of sudokus with no solution. 
Also displays how much time it takes to find solution to a particular puzzle.
